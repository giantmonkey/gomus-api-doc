# Preparation

Before you can use the go~mus reseller API to create valid orders, you will have to register a user account with an API key. Please talk to your contact person in order to get access.

<aside class="success">
Remember — a happy api user is an authenticated api user!
</aside>


See [detailed documentation on Public API](/public_api.html) for information on how to request the basic data for events, tours and tickets.


# Orders

An order is the final result of a checkout process, e.g. like in normal online shops. Every ticket sale or event booking is wrapped into items in a cart and sent to the server for validation.

The server-side will do a final validation and return whether our order was successful.
In a success case a JSON with the valid order will be returned.

Note: the payment handling, including access to third party tools, might differ depending on your API plan.


## List of exisiting orders

Existing orders in your account can be accessed at the orders index endpoint:

`GET https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders`

```shell
curl "https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
    "orders": [
        {
            "id": 3944805,
            "token": "Aniq532VCewghH2mUtEnng",
            "is_valid": true,

- page, defaults to `1`

### Response

The json response contains a list of existing orders as an array and a meta block.

- id (integer), the unique database id of the order
- token (string), a unique token of the order, see more at the documents section

## Details of a single order

`GET https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders/:id`

```shell
curl "https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders/1"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like a single element of the orders array from the order list but with two additional keys:

```json
{
    "order": {
        ...

        "payment_status": 30,
        "billing_address_id": 378542,

        ...
    }

}
```


### Response

- payment_status (integer), if using a payment provider, the status is set by the provider. Usualy not in use for resellers.
- billing_address_id (integer), reference to an address dataset. Not in use right now, but in future versions of th API resellers might be able to use several adresses for one account.


## Find single order by barcode

`GET https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders/barcode/:barcode`

```shell
curl "https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders/barcode/704323341"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured just like the details of a single order.

### Barcodes

The barcode may belong to any item that is contained in the order.




## Documents

Each order item has a pdf document containing the relevant information according to the item type. Ticket item pdfs contain the tickets: one per page. Event and tour items have a pdf containing the booking confirmation.

These are available to download if the order `is_valid` and if there is a `token` present.

Some orders may have an invoice available (indicated by the `invoice` attribute in the order).

Some orders may have passbooks for tickets available (indicated by the `passbooks` attribute in the ticket sale in order).

Due to the token confirmation, authentication via header request is not needed for the document requests.

### Tickets

- ticket_id means the uniq ticket sale id (order -> order item -> ticket sale)

### Passbooks

`GET https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders/:order_id/tickets/:ticket_id/passbooks/:barcode.pkpass?token=:token`

Each item contains generic attributes like

- id (integer), the uniq database id of the order item
- type (string), the type of item, can be one of "Ticket", "Event", or "Tour"
- price_cents (integer), price of the item in EUR cents

    }
}
```


### Attributes

Each event type item contains attributes like

- id (integer), the uniq database id this event booking
- title (string), the title of the event
- tour_id (integer), the database id of the tour
- start_time (iso8601), the timestamp for the tour
- participants (integer)
- language (string)
- age group_(string)

plus attribute blocks for the location and prices

### Location

The location is provided as street adress and geo-coordinates. Mind that most museums have no house number.

### Prices

The price of a tour booking depends on several pricing factors like surcharges and other fees. The `prices` array holds all single price items which are summed up to the order items `price_cents` total.

### Equipments

The tour item may contain an additional block for booking equipment at the **same** start time:

```json
    equipment: [
      {
        id: 1,
        quantity: 3
      }
    ]
```

# Creating an Order

An order is created by a POST request to the orders endpoint:

`POST https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders`

There can be only one order per request. One order can contain several items (tickets, tour bookings and event bookings)

A final validation check will be made on the server. Either all order items are bought or none.
In case of errors you will get error messages back as a response.

> Write definition of order into /tmp/order.json before executing shell command.

```shell
curl "https://demo.gomus.de/api/v4/orders"
    -XPOST --data "@/tmp/order.json"
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command assumes the order.json JSON is structured like this:

```json
{
  "comment": "Please send fast!",
  "reference": "bought you by the awesome tourist gmbh!",
  "items": [
    ...
  ],
  "total": 1400
}
```

### Required attributes

- comment (text), your comment, not readable on confirmation documents
- reference (text), your reference, readable on confirmation documents
- items (array), list of item configurations
- total (integer), the sum of all item prices. This ensures that the server and the client calculate the same price.

## Items

A valid order needs at least one valid item. One item can either be a ticket sale, an event booking or a tour booking.

An item has two major attributes:

- type (text), one of "Ticket", "Event", or "Tour"
- attributes (hash), a set of attributes specific to the item type

### Ticket


> a single item holding a ticket sale is structured like this:


```json
{
    "type": "Ticket",
    "attributes": {
        "id": 247,
        "quantity": 1,
        "time": "2016-07-07T13:00:00+02:00",
        "reservations": ["8CE0mEgjyAvQB1IbPJ4iyg"],
        "attendees":[
          {
            "name":"Capt'n",
            "surname":"Hook"
          },
          {
            "name":"Peter",
            "surname":"Pan"
          }
        ]
        
    }
}
```


A ticket item has a fairly simple structure:

- id (integer), the tickets id, see ticket section in public api
- quantity (integer), a count > 0
- time (iso8601), the entry timestamp
- reservations (array of tokens), if any (see Tickets -> Reservations for more info)
- attendees (array of objects), needs to be set on purchase when ticket's attendees are required. Attendees require a name and surname. Number of attendees needs to match the ticket sales quantity. 


### Event

> a single item holding an event booking is structured like this:


```json
{
    "type": "Event",
    "attributes": {
        "id": 28227,
        "quantity": 5
    }
}
```

> or with several price options:

```json
{
    "type": "Event",
    "attributes": {
        "id": 28227,
        "quantities": {
            "1": 2,
            "4": 3
        }
    }
}
```

An event item has a similar structure:

- id (integer), the events date id, see event section in public api

If the event only has one price, the quantity key is used.

- quantity (integer), a count > 0

However, if the event has scale pricing, then the quantities key is used instead:

- quantities (object), the scale price id as the key, and the quantity as the value.

### Tour

> a single item holding a tour booking is structured like this:


```json
{
    "type": "Tour",
    "attributes": {
        "id": 28227,
        "start_time": "2016-07-07T13:00:00+02:00",
        "language_id": 1,
        "age_group_id": 3,
        "quantity": 5,
        "surcharges": {
            "1": 2,
            "4": 3
        }
    }
}
```

> or with several price options:

```json
{
    "type": "Tour",
    "attributes": {
        "id": 28227,
        "start_time": "2016-07-07T13:00:00+02:00",
        "language_id": 1,
        "age_group_id": 3,
        "quantities": {
            "1": 2,
            "4": 3
        },
        "surcharges": {
            "1": 2,
            "4": 3
        }
    }
}
```

A tour item extends the structure of events:

- id (integer), the tour id, see tour section in public api
- surcharges (object), the surcharge id as the key, and the quantity as the value
- start_time (iso8601), the entry timestamp
- language_id (reference)
- age_group_id (reference)

If the tour only has one price, the quantity key is used.

- quantity (integer), a count > 0

However, if the tour has scale pricing, then the quantities key is used instead:

- quantities (object), the scale price id as the key, and the quantity as the value

Surcharge configuration must be provided if tour is configured with surcharges (see tour section in the public api). The surcharge configuration is validated on server side.

Note: the quantity or sum of quantities represents the number of participants (people in group)
